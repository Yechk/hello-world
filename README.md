My hello world

My name is Alex and I'm obsessed with breaking things down to the bare bones. Instead of just brewing a cup of coffee, I will instead cultivate my own field of coffee trees and dry the beans for 6 months before grinding them to brew one cup of joe.

I can be highly adaptable to new problems, and I love solving them.

Favorite languages: c++ (planting Coffee trees), Python (Folgers), 6502 Assembly (Molecular bean research)
